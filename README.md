# Space-Rush-Cpp-Game
"Space Rush" is a "Space Invaders" clone created using C++ language and SGG library.

Its main goal is to survive all waves of enemies and try to get higher scores everytime you play.

The game starts with 6 lives(half heart each) and 4 shields, which have 3 states(Green, Orange, Red).

For every enemy you kill, you get a specific amount of points and after you clear one wave, another one a bit faster attacks

For each wave you clear you get half a heart back as a reward.

In case the player loses, he/she has the option to start over again or press Esc and close the game.
